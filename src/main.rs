        // and the match expression will just return the num value that parse produced and put inside
        // the Ok value. That number will end up right where we want it in the new guess variable we’re creating.
        // If parse is not able to turn the string into a number, it will return an Err value that
        // contains more information about the error. The Err value does not match the Ok(num)
        // pattern in the first match arm, but it does match the Err(_) pattern in the second arm.
        // The underscore, _, is a catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all
        // Err values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will execute
        // the second arm’s code, continue, which tells the program to go to the next iteration of

        // Then it returns a variant of the Ordering enum we brought into scope with the use statement.
        // We use a match expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of Ordering was
        // returned from the call to cmp with the values in guess and secret_number.
